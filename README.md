# README

Running the WebdriverIO sample test files in docker containers. Demonstration of how we can slightly modify our configuration to run both our tests and our browser in containers so they can be put into a CI system. 

To run the tests via Docker:

1. Ensure Docker is up and running
2. Run `npm run test:docker`


### Credit

Thanks to Kevin Lamping for creating the initial outline for this. Thanks to Promenade Group for hiring Kevin to do this (and other things). This is a similar configuration to how we run our WebdriverIO tests at Promenade Group. 

### Warranty

You are free to use these files, but we don't warranty our work. If it works, great. If not you can file an issue and we will take a look but no promises. =)
